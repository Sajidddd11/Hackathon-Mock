📘 HackTheAI – Preliminary
Timeline
The hackathon is structured in multiple phases:
* Preliminary Round (Online): Participants will build API endpoints using preferred language and frameworks. Based on scores, the best 50 teams will be selected for the Final Round.
   * Mock Preliminary: 14th September, 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM
   * Final Preliminary: 15th September, 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM
* Idea Submission and Final Registration: 16th-17th September, 2025
* Final Round (22nd – 25th September 2025):
   * 22nd – 24th September (Online): Selected teams will begin developing their main project.
   * 25th September (Onsite at Green University of Bangladesh): Teams will continue and finalize the same project and then present it to the judges.
* Theme: The Final Round will be an open idea, giving teams the freedom to innovate in any domain, as long as some of the AI related features are built with SmythOS Flow Builder.
Rules & Guidelines
Project Scope
* Projects must be a backend REST API that implements endpoints provided in the problemset.
* The backend doesn’t need to use any database, data may just be stored in the memory or files.
* Try making the response time of the API as fast as possible as there are points for response time. 
Tools & Resources
* Participants can use any programming language, framework, or open-source tools.
* Participants must containerize the backend API
* You may use the following templates as a starter (make sure to only copy the folder with you preferred language and framework)

Submission (Google form)
* Only one member from a team should submit.
* Teams must create a Private GitHub repository and should submit the repository URL along with the ZIP file of the project (do not include program dependency such as node_modules) before the deadline.
* The ZIP file needs to be named according to the team handle provided here 
* Provide access to the repo to the following GitHub Users
   * https://github.com/Ataullha
   * https://github.com/nurulhudaapon
   * https://github.com/idontbyte69
* In case of multiple submissions the last one will be evaluated.
* Late submissions will not be accepted.
Judging Criteria
* The automated judge will execute the following command at the root of your repository folder to run your application
   * docker compose up -d –build
   * And then we will invoke all the API endpoints with test cases.
      * Example:  
      *  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/members \
      * -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      * -d '{"member_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 22}'


* Make sure to expose your API endpoint on port 8000
